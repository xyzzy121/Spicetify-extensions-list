# Spicetify extensions list
This is a list of spicetify extensions I like.

https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Dribbblish
	A UI Overhaul
https://github.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme
	Same as above, but the theme changes with the album cover's color.
https://github.com/daksh2k/Spicetify-stuff/blob/master/Extensions/fullScreen.js
	Adds a nice full screen mode
https://github.com/jeroentvb/spicetify-playlist-icons
	adds icons to the playlist list. Wow, that makes no sense gramatically.
https://github.com/Daksh777/SpotifyNoPremium
	For those of us who are broke, this is a lifesaver. it removes ads, nad the upgrade button and stuff.
